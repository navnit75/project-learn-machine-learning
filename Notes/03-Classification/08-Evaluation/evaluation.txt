-- Different expressions used in the Confusion Matrix is in the image, showing the example of logistic regression. 
-- Such as False positive, False Negative, True Positive , True Negative 


Accuracy Paradox: 
-- Lets imagine there are two classes a arbitary value can be predicted to . 
-- Sometimes in certain situations when the one of the prediction doesn't occur. 
-- The model accuracy shown to increase. Which creates a paradox. 
-- That's why it is told not to completely rely on the predictions of confusion matrix. 

Another Method Called Cumulative Accuracy Profile:
 -- You take a curve made from random values, then you compare your result with that random curve. 
 -- You also take cystral curve, the absolute possibility curve , which gives us 100% accuracy. 
 -- Then we compare the area under these curves to predict the accuracy. 
 -- Shown an example in the images.
