# INTRODUCTION:

- Dimension reduction model
- Unsupervised
- imagine your data set have 20 features , but you have good eye for details and you know that only two or three of features are enough to predict the result.
- so you apply technique of dimensionality reduction.
- and you train your data for one of the models
- then you predict the result

# PROCESS:

- you try to find the principal axis along which the data is aligned ,
- using which you project them on a smaller dimension to understand the difference.
