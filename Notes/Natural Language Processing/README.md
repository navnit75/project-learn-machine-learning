# INTRODUCTION

1. Natural Language processing (intersection) Deep Learning = Deep NLP

## Bag of Words:

1. 20000 is mostly people speak
2. a list can be created of 20,000
3. Specification of list
4. 0 : SOS
5. 1 : EOS
6. last : Special words , which doesn't comes under 20,000 will come under last index
7. Goal of the NLP could be something like,
   - Ex. : I have recieved an email ?
   - As gmail creates automatic replies --> Similar way , we need to automate the reply.
   - Using our previous replies for email.
8. We use the training data to train the model such as Logistic Regression. And predict what could be reply in YES / NO.
9. Instead of logistic regressions more complicated algorithms like CNN also can be used to define.
