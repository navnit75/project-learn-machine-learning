## R SQUARED INTITUTION:

---

- Basically tells how good is our regression line compared to the SS tot line.
- Can be applied for Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Our motive here is to reduce SSresidual ---> Minimise. So that we get greater R^2.
- Problem occurs when the number of variable increses to three?

## ADJUSTED R SQUARED: -

---

- Usually happens when we introduce a new variable , in regression.
- The model will check R^2 value. If the SS residual decreases it just keep the constant value assosiated with that value as 0.
- So R^2 in the case of variable addittion will never decrease.
- This creates an issue, as you will never know which variable is good for the model , as it always increases the R value
- That's where adjusted R squared Intitution comes into play
- Formula penalises for the independent variables that do not do any good---> It decreases.
